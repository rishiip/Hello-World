New to Open Source?  
New to Github?  
Don't know where to Start?  
Don't know how to Start? :confused:  

**Here is the One Stop Solution for Every Newcomer!**

## 1. Begin with learning about Git and Github! How it works and learn about the various Commands. :octocat:

You can take any one of the following courses/videos. One is just sufficient. If you want you take more than one too! 

### 1.1 Here are some Youtube Tutorials/Videos
* [Git and Github for Poets by The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV) (It's for everyone and not just poets :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)
* [What is Git | What is GitHub | Git Tutorial | GitHub Tutorial | Devops Tutorial | Edureka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuB1Id2Wxak)

### 1.2 Here are some Free Courses :free:
* [Pick any Free Udemy Course for learning Git](https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?q=git&src=ukw&p=1&price=price-free&lang=en)
* [Version Control with Git by Udacity](https://in.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123)

## 2. Contribute Here! Follow these steps (Better try it yourself first!)

### 2.1 Fork this Repository :fork_and_knife:(commonly called as Repo)
Fork this Repo by clicking on the Fork button on the top of this page. This will create a copy of this Repo in your Github account.

### 2.3 Create a branch :twisted_rightwards_arrows:
Change to the Repo directory on your Computer by running
